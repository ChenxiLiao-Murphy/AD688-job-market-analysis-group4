# About This Project
This project explores the evolving landscape of the U.S. job market through the lens of geographic distribution and remote work trends. Leveraging Lightcast's extensive job postings dataset, we analyze how employment patterns differ across regions, industries, and occupations, with a focus on:

* The rise of AI-related job opportunities versus non-AI roles;

* Regional shifts in job availability and growth across states and metropolitan areas;

* The impact and distribution of remote, hybrid, and onsite work models;

* Emerging career paths in both urban and rural labor markets.

By combining Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Spark SQL, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (including PCA and clustering), our project aims to uncover hidden structures in job posting data and generate actionable insights for students, job seekers, and policymakers navigating the post-pandemic workforce.

This project was developed as part of AD688 Web Analytics and Big Data Tools at Boston University, integrating large-scale data processing and visualization techniques to inform real-world workforce decisions.

# Team Members and Contributions

This project was a collaborative effort conducted by a three-member team, with each member responsible for distinct technical and strategic modules:

- **Xiangwen (Rosa) Wang** (<wxwrosa@bu.edu>)  
  Led the **Data Cleaning & EDA** phase, including preprocessing of raw datasets, remote/AI classification, and visualization of job distributions.  
  Spearheaded the **NLP-based Skill Gap Analysis**, extracting in-demand skills and aligning them with team competencies.  
  Oversaw the **entire project timeline**, coordinated team deliverables ahead of deadlines, and ensured design consistency across all `.qmd` files and the Quarto website.  
  Played a central role in structuring the final report and presentation layout.

- **Chenxi (Murphy) Liao** (<murphyy@bu.edu>)  
  Responsible for both **Unsupervised Learning** and **Supervised Learning** modules.  
  Applied **KMeans clustering** to identify job market segments based on occupational and geographic features, and implemented classification/regression models to analyze remote type and salary trends.

- **Yijiun (Eugenia) Tseng** (<yijiun@bu.edu>)  
  Focused on the **Enhanced EDA** module, producing in-depth geographic visualizations of job type and remote patterns.  
  Co-developed the **Skill Gap Analysis**, emphasizing skill demand trends and upskilling recommendations for target roles.
