# Exploratory Data Analysis

This page summarizes the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset, including key trends and patterns.

_Content will be added here._


## Salary Distribution

We begin by examining the overall distribution of average salaries in the dataset.

```{python}
import plotly.express as px

fig = px.histogram(df, x="average_salary", nbins=40, title="Salary Distribution")
fig.update_layout(template="plotly_white")
fig.show()
```

This histogram shows how salaries are spread across roles. We observe that most salaries cluster within a specific range, with some high-paying outliers.

## Salary by State

Next, we compare salary ranges across U.S. states to reveal geographic trends.

```{python}
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.boxplot(data=df, x="state", y="average_salary")
plt.title("Salary Distribution by State")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Certain states exhibit higher salary medians than others, reflecting regional disparities in job market compensation.

## Top Job Titles in Demand

We identify the most common job titles from the dataset.

```{python}
top_titles = df["job_title"].value_counts().nlargest(10)
top_titles.plot(kind="barh", title="Top 10 Job Titles")
```

This bar chart reveals which roles are most frequently advertised, offering a snapshot of in-demand professions.

## Remote vs Onsite Salary Comparison

We also analyze how remote work impacts compensation.

```{python}
import plotly.express as px

fig = px.box(df, x="remote_type", y="average_salary", title="Remote vs Onsite Salary")
fig.update_layout(template="plotly_white")
fig.show()
```

Remote roles may offer competitive pay depending on job type and industry, providing insights for job seekers prioritizing flexibility.
